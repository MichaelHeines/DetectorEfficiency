This code is made for the fitting of photon detection efficiency as a function of energy.

Some utility functions are available in __fitUtility__.py, __plotUtility__.py, and __traceUtility__.py

Besides that, two notebooks are included:
- paper_notebook.ipynb was used to perform the investigations in [1]
- efficiency_fitting.ipynb provides an easy to use example for basic efficiency fitting


Before running:
Since pymc and arviz occasionally have some issues during installation, an environment yml file is added. This file can be interpreted by anaconda or miniconda to create an environment in which the code should run.

Create directory "traces" and "images" to drop output files
