This code is made for the fitting of photon detection efficiency as a function of energy.

Some utility functions are available in __fitUtility__.py, __plotUtility__.py, and __traceUtility__.py

Besides that, two notebooks are included:
- paper_notebook.ipynb was used to perform the investigations in [1]
- efficiency_fitting.ipynb provides an easy to use example for basic efficiency fitting


Before running, create two directories "images" and "traces" in the same folder if they do not already exist.
